## Description

Playing around with "The _Countdown_ problem" (pearl number 20) from _Pearls of Functional Algorithm Design_ by Richard Bird.

## TODO

* Type in all 5 versions of the Haskell code from the book
    * ~~countdown1~~
    * ~~countdown2~~
    * ~~countdown3~~
    * countdown4
    * countdown5
* Try it in C#
* Add a GUI front end to the Haskell code - maybe in Elm ?
* Add a GUI front end to the C# code - maybe in WPF ?
